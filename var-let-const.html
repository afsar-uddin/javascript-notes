                <strong>Definition</strong>
                <p><b>var</b> var is used for variable declaration and it's global scoped variable. var is defined
                    throughout the function but not if it's declared in a block as it's not block-scoped.
                    <b>On the other hand, hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations
                        are moved to the top
                        of their scope before code execution.
                    </b>
                </p>
                <p><b>let</b> let statement is block-scoped and not a global scope. This statement can be used in
                    function as it is function-scoped and one of the main character of <b>let</b> statement is that it
                    can be reassigned.</p>
                <p><b>const</b> To declare varibles with the <b>const</b> maintain constant values, which cannt
                    reassigned. <b>const</b> declarations can only be accessed within the block they were declared.</p>
            </div>

            <b>Summary: </b> <br>
            <p>1) <b>var</b> declaration are globally scoped or function scoped while <b>let</b> and <b>const</b> are
                block scoped</p>
            <p>2) <b>var</b> varibales can be updated and re-declared within it's scope; <b>let</b> variables can be
                updated but not re-declared; <b>const</b> variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.</p>
            <p>3) They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while <b>var</b> variables are initialized with
                <b>undefined</b>, <b>let</b> and <b>const</b> variables are not initialized.
