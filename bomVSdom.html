                <strong>Definition</strong>
                <p><b>BOM</b> main task is to manage browser windows and enable communication between the windows (i.e
                    BOM deals with entire browser). Each HTML page which is loaded into a browser window becomes a
                    Document object and a document object is an object in the BOM. You can say BOM is a superset of DOM.
                    BOM has many objects, methods, and properties that are not part of the DOM structure.</p>
                <p><b>DOM</b> stands for Document Object Model. It is a standard defined by W3C (World Wide Web
                    Consortium) and is specific to current HTML document (i.e DOM deals with document alone). DOM is a
                    programming interface (API) for representing and interacting with HTML, XHTML and XML documents. It
                    organizes the elements of the document in a tree structure (DOM tree) and in the DOM tree, all
                    elements of the document are defined as objects (tree nodes) which have properties and methods.</p>
                <p><b>DOM</b> is a subset of BOM, we can manipulate DOM tree with the help of JavaScript for
                    example.</p>
